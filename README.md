# üß† Simulated Mini SoC Lab

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** design and verification environment created to simulate the key components of an embedded processor system.  
This project emulates the structure of a professional SoC lab ‚Äî focusing on **CPU design, memory hierarchy, and peripheral interfacing** ‚Äî without requiring virtual machines or proprietary EDA tools.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This lab models the core principles of SoC development using HDL-based design flows.  
It includes modular Verilog source files, testbenches, and example scripts that illustrate the design process of a **minimal RISC-style processor** integrated with basic peripherals and memory subsystems.

> ‚öôÔ∏è While this repository does not run on actual EDA tools, it represents a *realistic structure and documentation* of a hardware design workflow suitable for educational and portfolio purposes.

## üß© System Architecture

The Mini SoC comprises:
- **CPU Core** ‚Äî 16-bit RISC architecture with ALU, control unit, and register file  
- **Memory System** ‚Äî Separate instruction and data memory with a memory controller  
- **Peripherals** ‚Äî UART, GPIO, and Timer modules  
- **Bus Interface** ‚Äî Simplified bus for internal communication

## üß† Design Highlights

- **ALU** supports 8 arithmetic and logic operations  
- **Control Unit** implements a single-cycle instruction decode mechanism  
- **Register File** with two read ports and one write port  
- **Memory Controller** manages synchronous read/write access  
- **UART Peripheral** demonstrates serial communication interface

## üß™ Simulation (Conceptual)

Simulation scripts are provided for educational demonstration.  
Example workflow (non-executable but realistic):

```bash
# Compile design files
./scripts/compile.sh

# Run top-level SoC testbench
./scripts/run_tests.sh

# View waveform (if using ModelSim or GTKWave)
vsim -do scripts/wave_viewer.do
